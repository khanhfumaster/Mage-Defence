8.2 Maintenance of Confidential Information.

8.4 Survival. Licensee's obligations under this Article 8 will survive the termination of this Agreement or of any license granted under this Agreement for whatever reason.

9. WARRANTIES; SUPERIOR RIGHTS.

9.1 Ownership. Except for the rights, if any of the Government of the United States, as set forth hereinbelow, Khanh represents its belief that it is the owner of the entire right, title, and interest in and to Software, and that it has the sole right to grant licenses thereunder, and that it has not knowingly granted licenses thereunder to any other entity that would restrict rights granted hereunder except as stated herein.

9.2 Government Rights. Licensee understands that the Software may have been developed under a funding agreement with the Government of the United States of America and, if so, that the Government may have certain rights relative thereto. This Agreement is explicitly made subject to the Government's rights under any such agreement and any applicable law or regulation, if any. To the extent that there is a conflict between any such agreement, applicable law or regulation and this Agreement, the terms of such Government agreement, applicable law or regulation shall prevail. Distribution of the Software to any government agency by Licensee shall not be subject to the payments set forth above.

9.3 Limited Warranty. Khanh represents and warrants to Licensee that the Software, when properly installed by Licensee and used with the Designated Equipment, will perform substantially as described in Khanh's then current Documentation for such Software for a period of ninety (90) days from the date of shipment.

9.4 Limitations. Notwithstanding the warranty provisions set forth in Section 9.3 above, all of Khanh's obligations with respect to such warranties shall be contingent on Licensee's use of the Software in accordance with this Agreement and in accordance with Khanh's instructions as provided by Khanh in the Documentation, as such instructions may be amended, supplemented, or modified by Khanh from time to time. Khanh shall have no warranty obligations with respect to any failures of the Software which are the result of accident, abuse, misapplication, extreme power surge or extreme electromagnetic field.

9.5 Licensee's Sole Remedy. Khanh's entire liability and Licensee's exclusive remedy shall be, at Khanh's option, either (a) return of the price paid or (b) repair or replacement of the Software upon its return to Khanh; provided Khanh receives written notice from Licensee during the warranty period of a breach of warranty. Any replacement Software will be warranted for the remainder of the original warranty period or thirty (30) days, whichever is longer.

9.6 Disclaimer of Warranties. Khanh DOES NOT REPRESENT OR WARRANT THAT ALL ERRORS IN THE SOFTWARE AND DOCUMENTATION WILL BE CORRECTED. THE WARRANTIES STATED IN SECTION 9.3 ABOVE ARE THE SOLE AND THE EXCLUSIVE WARRANTIES OFFERED BY Khanh. THERE ARE NO OTHER WARRANTIES RESPECTING THE SOFTWARE AND DOCUMENTATION OR SERVICES PROVIDED HEREUNDER, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO ANY WARRANTY OF DESIGN, MERCHANTABILITY, OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, EVEN IF Khanh HAS BEEN INFORMED OF SUCH PURPOSE. NO AGENT OF Khanh IS AUTHORIZED TO ALTER OR EXCEED THE WARRANTY OBLIGATIONS OF Khanh AS SET FORTH HEREIN.

9.7 Limitation of Liability. LICENSEE ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT THE CONSIDERATION WHICH Khanh IS CHARGING HEREUNDER DOES NOT INCLUDE ANY CONSIDERATION FOR ASSUMPTION BY Khanh OF THE RISK OF LICENSEE'S CONSEQUENTIAL OR INCIDENTAL DAMAGES WHICH MAY ARISE IN CONNECTION WITH LICENSEE'S USE OF THE SOFTWARE AND DOCUMENTATION. ACCORDINGLY, LICENSEE AGREES THAT Khanh SHALL NOT BE RESPONSIBLE TO LICENSEE FOR ANY LOSS-OF-PROFIT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE LICENSING OR USE OF THE SOFTWARE OR DOCUMENTATION. Any provision herein to the contrary notwithstanding, the maximum liability of Khanh to any person, firm or corporation whatsoever arising out of or in the connection with any license, use or other employment of any Software delivered to Licensee hereunder, whether such liability arises from any claim based on breach or repudiation of contract, warranty, tort or otherwise, shall in no case exceed the actual price paid to Khanh by Licensee for the Software whose license, use, or other employment gives rise to the liability. The essential purpose of this provision is to limit the potential liability of Khanh arising out of this Agreement. The parties acknowledge that the limitations set forth in this Article 9 are integral to the amount of consideration levied in connection with the license of the Software and Documentation and any services rendered hereunder and that, were Khanh to assume any further liability other than as set forth herein, such consideration would of necessity be set substantially higher.

10. INDEMNIFICATION

10.1 Khanh shall indemnify, hold harmless and defend Licensee against any action brought against Licensee to the extent that such action is based on a claim that the unmodified Software, when used in accordance with this Agreement, infringes a United States copyright and Khanh shall pay all costs, settlements and damages finally awarded; provided, that Licensee promptly notifies Institution in writing of any claim, gives Khanh sole control of the defense and settlement thereof and provides all reasonable assistance in connection therewith. If any Software is finally adjudged to so infringe, or in Khanh's opinion is likely to become the subject of such a claim, Khanh shall, at its option, either: (i) procure for Licensee the right to continue using the Software (ii) modify or replace the Software to make it noninfringing, or (iii) refund the fee paid, less reasonable depreciation, upon return of the Software. Khanh shall have no liability regarding any claim arising out of: (w) use of other than a current, unaltered release of the Software unless the infringing portion is also in the then current, unaltered release, (x) use of the Software in combination with non-Khanh software, data or equipment if the infringement was caused by such use or combination, (y) any modification or derivation of the Software not specifically authorized in writing by Khanh or (z) use of third party software. THE FOREGOING STATES THE ENTIRE LIABILITY OF Khanh AND THE EXCLUSIVE REMEDY FOR LICENSEE RELATING TO INFRINGEMENT OR CLAIMS OF INFRINGEMENT OF ANY COPYRIGHT OR OTHER PROPRIETARY RIGHT BY THE SOFTWARE.

10.2 Except for the foregoing infringement claims, Licensee shall indemnify and hold harmless System, Khanh, their Regents, officers, agents and employees from and against any claims, demands, or causes of action whatsoever, including without limitation those arising on account of Licensee's modification or enhancement of the Software or otherwise caused by, or arising out of, or resulting from, the exercise or practice of the license granted hereunder by Licensee, its sublicensees, if any, its subsidiaries or their officers, employees, agents or representatives.
